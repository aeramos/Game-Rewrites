list of features missing:
cities having a limited stock of items
viewing the prices of other cities without going to them
other npcs, both friendly neutral and enemy
other members of party
combat
base combat
equipping items
factions and their quests/missions
reputation
crime rate

refreshing the stock should change it by more variable amounts than +/- 10%
ideally the city would store the slope of the price graph, meaning that if the price started rising quickly (steep slope),
it would keep on rising for a while as the slope evens out again
make the randomness not a 50/50 chance. make it like 70/30 with 70% chance to do the previous action to the slope (either increase or decrease by 1% or 2% or something).
