# Game-Rewrites
### Experiments in game programming.

This repository is to hold my implementations of various Flash games that I played when I was
younger. This is mostly as an exercise so that I can experiment with different styles of code design
and structure. I chose to recreate other games rather than make my own to allow me to focus on just
writing code without also having to design a game.
